'''
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        left = root.left
        right = root.right
        if not left and not right:
            return
        if left.val < root.val and root.val < right.val:
            return self.isValidBST(left) and self.isValidBST(right)
        else:
            return False
